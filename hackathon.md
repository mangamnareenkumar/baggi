# HACKATHON 7.

**Title of Hackathon:** Develop a mobile based secure offline facial recognition and liveness detection system for
remote locations.

**The Objective:** To develop a highly accurate, lightweight, and entirely offline facial recognition and liveness
detection algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing Datalake 3.0 app, ensuring uninterrupted
operations in zero-network zones.

**The Problem Statement:** "How can we accurately and securely authenticate field personnel using facial
recognition and liveness detection on standard mid-range mobile devices without any active internet connection,
while ensuring the AI model remains lightweight and seamlessly integrates with a React Native application on
both android and iOS devices?"

**Target Audience:** Open to IT Students, AI/ML Enthusiasts, App Developers, Tech Professionals, and Startups

**Technical Constraints & Specifications:**

**1. Framework Compatibility:** Must be fully compatible with React Native, supporting cross-functional
    deployment on both Android and iOS.
**2. Model Footprint:** The AI model must be extremely lightweight to avoid bloating the Datalake app
    package. The target size is ~20 MB (the smaller, the better).
**3. Processing Speed:** Time taken to recognize a face and verify liveness must be < 1 second on standard mid-
    range devices.
**4. Hardware Requirements:** Must function smoothly without requiring high-end GPUs. Minimum supported
    OS: Android 8.0+ and iOS 12+ on devices with a minimum of 3GB RAM.
**5. Accuracy Threshold:** The facial recognition accuracy must be > 95%. The model must be trained to
    recognize diverse Indian demographics and function reliably in varying outdoor lighting conditions (e.g.,
    harsh sunlight, low light, shadows).
**6. Open-Source Technologies only:** Solution should use only open-source technologies if at all any third-
    party code is used and source-code of the working prototype should be shared. No licenses should be
    required additionally.

**Mandatory Deliverables**

**1. Working Prototype with Source Code:** A functional cross-platform prototype (Android + iOS) built in React
    Native demonstrating the offline capability.
       **a. Offline Liveness Detection:** The solution must include basic offline anti-spoofing measures (e.g.,
          requiring the user to blink, smile, or turn their head slightly) to prevent attendance fraud via
          photographs or screens.
       **b. Sync & Purge Mechanism:** The solution should have the scope for sync with AWS server after
          network connectivity is restored (local data to be purged)
**2. Presentation and Technical Documentation:** The solution should be well presented in a pptx. / .pdf file
    along with clear technical documentation detailing the model architecture, integration steps and
    performance benchmarks.
